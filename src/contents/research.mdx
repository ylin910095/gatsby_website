## Nucleon Axial Form Factor with Staggered Fermions ##
My PhD research focuses on calculating the axial form factor, $F_A(Q)$, of nucleons with staggered fermions.
This quantity encapsulates the reaction between a proton or neutron and a $W$ boson,
and at zero momentum transfer, $F_A(Q=0) = g_A$, it is the well-measured 
[nucleon axial charge](https://pdglive.lbl.gov/DataBlock.action?node=S017AV&init=0) that can be 
related to the neutron lifetime of about 15 minutes.

I and my collaborators proposed to tackle the calculation using staggered fermions for both sea and valence quarks. 
Staggered fermions are efficient to simulate but it suffers from complicated
continuum limits from the remnant [fermion doublers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion_doubling).
There has been a long and successful history of simulating lattice gauge theory with staggered fermions especially for 
mesonic observables (for examples, see [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0407028) 
and [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04223)). 
The challenge for baryonic observables is greater as the
breaking pattern of continuum to lattice symmetry is even more complicated. 

We started with the simplest observables - nucleon mass - and presented our results 
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12256)
with full error budget based on [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0550321385901385) 
and [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0611023). It represents the first calculation of the nucleon mass using staggered fermion setup which demonstrates the feasibility of our simulation, and lays the theoretical foundation of our future work. 

In the soon-to-be-published work, we will present the results of nucleon axial charge, $g_A$. The theory of the staggered baryon matrix elements is unexplored in the 
literature as it is unclear how to relate the unphysical matrix elements (wrong isospin quantum number
for example), which is oftentimes the most convenient to simulate, to the physical ones. We will present the 
general solution to this long-standing problem that could lead to more precise determination
of nucleon observables in the future. The work can also be extended easily to non-zero momentum transfer to calculate
the form factor which I am currently working on.
