Hi there! My name is Yin Lin (林胤).
I am a PhD student at [Enrico Fermi Institute](https://efi.uchicago.edu/) of [the University of Chicago](https://physics.uchicago.edu). 
I spend most my time at the theory department 
of [Fermilab](https://theory.fnal.gov/) studying [lattice gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_gauge_theory) under 
the mentorship of [Andreas Kronfeld](https://home.fnal.gov/~ask/) at Fermilab.

[Quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) (QCD) is
part of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) of 
particle physics that describes the strong force between quarks and nuclei. It is a notoriously difficult theory to solve and the only generic approach is using Monte-Carlo method with high-performance computation based on the theoretical framework of lattice QCD (LQCD). 
My main research interests include investigating nucleon observables with the first-principle calculations of LQCD and exploring potential pathways towards calculations of more complex systems.
